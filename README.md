Moisture sensor senses the ground, displays on screen then compares the value with the set value on the 7-segments.
if the screen value is lower than 7-segmet value then it will run the water pump until screen value is >= 7-segments'

there are 4 buttons. from right to left: turn on screen. change the pump condition for few seconds until it recompares. set moisture threshold value up and down buttons.
